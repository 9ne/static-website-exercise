                <p>In 1981, the U.S. Air Force identified a requirement for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) to
                  replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Code-named "Senior Sky", this air-superiority fighter
                  program was influenced by emerging worldwide threats, including new developments in Soviet air defense
                  systems and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 "Flanker"- and Mikoyan MiG-29 "Fulcrum"-class of
                  fighter aircraft. It would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon,
                  including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more
                  powerful propulsion systems, and most importantly, stealth technology. In 1983, the ATF concept
                  development team became the System Program Office (SPO) and managed the program at Wright-Patterson
                  Air Force Base. The demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) request for proposals (RFP) was issued in
                  September 1985, with requirements placing a strong emphasis on stealth and supercruise.</p>

                <p>The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display
                  offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed
                  upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a
                  force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement
                  direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was
                  abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27
                  inches tall (355 cm * 115 cm * 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds. The canopy was redesigned after the
                  original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours.</p>

                <p>The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce RCS
                  include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry
                  serpentine inlets and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces and turbines from
                  any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and
                  pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio
                  emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye.
                  The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzles reduce infrared emissions of the exhaust plume to
                  mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.[148]
                  Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling of
                  leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.</p>
